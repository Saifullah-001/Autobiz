# Week 1 Summary

## Goal of This Week
- Understand what GitHub is and why we use it
- Set up my first repository properly
- Learn the standard project structure
- Understand what documentation means in real projects

## What I Learned

### GitHub Basics
- GitHub is not just for storing code - it's a learning journal
- Every project needs its own repository
- Good documentation matters more than perfect code
- Commits should be small and frequent, not one big "final" upload

### Project Structure
- README.md = front page of the project
- docs/ = weekly learning documentation
- diagrams/ = visual explanations
- src/ = actual code/workflows
- logs/ = experiments and tests
- reflections.md = honest learning notes

## What I Built
- Created AutoBiz repository
- Added proper folder structure (docs, diagrams, src, logs)
- Created README.md file
- Created reflections.md file
- Started Week 1 documentation

## Problems I Faced
- Wasn't sure what to write in documentation before writing code
- Confused about whether to make repository public or private
- Didn't understand why we need so many folders for a simple project

## How I Solved Them
- Read the GitHub guide carefully
- Understood that documentation shows thinking, not just results
- Decided to make repository public to show confidence
- Realized the folders help organize learning, not just code

## What's Still Unclear
- How exactly will I use n8n (haven't explored it yet)
- What my first automation workflow should be
- How to create diagrams for this project

## Next Week Plan
- Start exploring n8n platform
- Watch n8n introduction tutorials
- Plan what my first automation will do
- Create a simple flow diagram of how the system should work
