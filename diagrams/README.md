#How does automation replace manual work?

Automation replaces manual work by using software to automatically handle repetitive tasks that humans would otherwise do manually. Instead of you checking forms, typing emails, and copying data by hand, the system does it instantly when triggered—like automatically sending a welcome email and saving customer info the moment someone submits a form. This saves time, eliminates errors, and lets you focus on more important work while the system handles routine tasks 24/7.
